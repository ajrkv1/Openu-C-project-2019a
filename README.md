# Openu-C-project-2019a
This is the project I had to do in C language, for the course "מעבדה בתכנות מערכות", in which I created a 2-passes assembler for a made up assembly language with 12-bit commands. I won't upload the assignment here because of copyright laws. The assembler takes a ".as" file and outputs a ".ob" file with every row as the assembled instruction, as ASCII charachters. it also outputs a ".ent" file that containes the entries in the file, and a ".ext" file that containes the externals in thr file.
